## Prerequisite

- Python >= 2.7
- pip
- git-lfs

## Build

1) Get sources from Github

```
git clone https://github.com/DOCTOR-ANR/cyber-data-extract.git
cd cyber-data-extract
```

2) Use pip to download dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use the script

Now you can use the script to generate a XML topology file (for CyberCAPTOR-Server), from several topological files (.CSV files and .XML vulnerability scan).

Here is a typical use of the script to generate the .XML topology file :

```
/usr/bin/python main.py --hosts-interfaces-file ./inputs/hosts-interfaces.csv --vlans-file ./inputs/vlan.csv --flow-matrix-file ./inputs/flow-matrix.csv --vulnerability-scan ./inputs/scan.nessus --routing-file ./inputs/routing.csv --to-fiware-xml-topology ./output/topology-generated.xml
```

This execution of the script parse the following inputs files:
  - `./inputs/hosts-interfaces.csv`: The CSV file describing the hosts and their network interfaces.
  - `./inputs/vlan.csv`: The CSV file describing the vlans and their default gateway.
  - `./inputs/flow-matrix.csv`: The CSV file describing the flow matrix inside the information system.
  - `./inputs/scan.nessus`: The XML file output of the Nessus scanner.
  - `./inputs/scan-generic.json`: The JSON file containing services/vulnerabilities in a generic format.
  - `./inputs/routing.csv`: The CSV file describing the routes of the routers.
  - `./inputs/hosts-vms.csv`: The CSV file describing placement of VMs on physical hosts.
  - `./inputs/controllers-hosts.csv`: The CSV file describing placement of machines (physical and virtual) in orchestration domains.
  - `./inputs/ndn-topo.csv`: The CSV file describing NDN links, in the case of a hybrid IP/NDN network.
  - `./inputs/input-gci.xml`: The entire topology from Generic Collector Interface (XML file). If this file is provided, no other is needed or read.
  - `./inputs/input-mmt.xml`: The entire topology from MMT Operator (XML file). If this file is provided, no other is needed or read.
  
The complete description of the inputs files can be found in [./doc/inputs-file-specifications.md](./doc/inputs-file-specifications.md).

It produces two output files:
  - `topology-generated.xml`: The XML file containing the description of the whole network topology.
	The exhaustive description of this XML file is provided in [./doc/topology-file-specifications.md](./doc/topology-file-specifications.md).
  - `mulval-output-file.P`: The mulval Datalog input file for this topology.

Here is the complete script manual:

## Docker build for CGI and MMT integration

Input generation from GCI or MMT XML file can be automated using the `auto-fetcher.py` file, and packaged in a standalone Docker container.

1) Copy and edit the config file

```
cp auto-fetcher-config.yaml.sample auto-fetcher-config.yaml
nano auto-fetcher-config.yaml
```

The `input` field can be either `gci` or `mmt`.
The `mode` field can be either `local` or `remote`. If it is set to `remote`, the input file will be fetched from the `source_url` URL, otherwise it will use the `local_input_file` file. In this last case, add the local file to the `examples/` directory.

2) Build the container

```
docker build -t cyber-data-extract .
```

3) Start the container

```
docker run -ti cyber-data-extract
```
